Greetings!

Professionally, I've been trying to automate myself out of my Sysadmin job for decades. Sadly, I've failed.

On this site, you may find posts about Electronics, Sysadmin work, Amateur Radio, and the occasional off-topic rant.

you can find my resume [here](http://www.2gn.com/~jjorgens/john_jorgensen_resume.html)
